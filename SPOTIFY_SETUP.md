# ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Spotify integration for your Dark Room app in simple, beginner-friendly steps!

## What Does Spotify Integration Do?

When enabled, you can **search for any song on Spotify** and attach it to your photos. When someone views your photo, they'll hear a 30-second preview of the song (this is what Spotify provides for free).

**Example**: You could attach "Blinding Lights" by The Weeknd to a photo of a sunset!

## Do I Need This?

**No!** The app works perfectly fine without Spotify. You can still:
- Upload audio files (MP3, etc.) from your computer
- Record voice messages directly

Spotify just gives you another option to find and attach songs.

## Setup Steps (Beginner-Friendly)

### Step 1: Create a Spotify Developer Account

1. Go to [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. It's **completely free** - no credit card needed!

### Step 2: Create an App

Think of this as telling Spotify "Hey, I'm building an app that wants to search for songs."

1. Click the **"Create app"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **App name**: "Dark Room" (or whatever you want)
   - **App description**: "Photo sharing app with audio"
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000` (just for now)
   - Check the box agreeing to terms
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Get Your Credentials

Credentials are like passwords that let your app talk to Spotify.

1. After creating the app, you'll see a screen with:
   - **Client ID**: A long string of letters and numbers
   - **Client Secret**: Click "View client secret" to see it
2. **Keep these secret!** Don't share them publicly.

### Step 4: Add Credentials to Your Project

1. In your project folder (where you have the Dark Room app), look for a file called `env.example`
2. Make a copy of it and name it `.env.local`:
   - On Mac/Linux: Open terminal and run `cp env.example .env.local`
   - On Windows: Copy the file and rename it to `.env.local`
3. Open `.env.local` in any text editor
4. Replace the placeholder text with your actual credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=paste_your_client_secret_here
```

**Example** (with fake credentials):
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=z9y8x7w6v5u4t3s2r1q0
```

### Step 5: Restart Your App

1. Stop your development server (press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal)
2. Start it again: `npm run dev`
3. Open your app and try the Spotify search!

## Troubleshooting

### "Spotify API not configured" error
- Make sure your `.env.local` file exists in the root folder (next to `package.json`)
- Check that you spelled the variable names exactly right
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Try restarting your dev server

### "Failed to search Spotify tracks" error
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure your Client ID and Secret are correct (no extra spaces)
- Try creating a new app in Spotify Developer Dashboard

### Search returns no results
- Make sure you're typing at least 2 characters
- Try a popular song like "Bohemian Rhapsody"
- Some songs don't have previews available - try a different one

## What Spotify Gives You (Free Tier)

- Search for any song in Spotify's catalog
- Get 30-second previews of songs
- Show album art and artist info
- No login required for your users!

## Security Note

Your `.env.local` file is automatically ignored by git, so your secrets won't be uploaded to GitHub. This is good! Always keep your credentials private.

## Need Help?

If you're stuck:
1. Make sure you followed each step exactly
2. Check the error message in your browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
3. Try the troubleshooting steps above
4. The app still works great without Spotify - you can use it and set up Spotify later!

Happy developing! ðŸ“·âœ¨
