## ✅ Step 1: Check Windows Microphone Settings

### Option A: Quick Method (Windows 11)
1. **Right-click** the **speaker icon** 🔊 in your taskbar (bottom-right corner)
2. Click **"Sound settings"**
3. Scroll down to the **"Input"** section
4. You should see:
   - A microphone device name (like "Microphone Array" or "Realtek Audio")
   - A blue bar that moves when you speak
5. **Test it**: Say "Hello" - the blue bar should move!
   - ✅ **Bar moves** → Your mic works, continue to Step 2
   - ❌ **Bar doesn't move** → Your mic is muted or wrong device selected

### Fix if bar doesn't move:
- Click the dropdown menu and **select a different microphone**
- Adjust the **"Input volume"** slider to 100%
- Make sure it says **"Connected"** not "Disconnected"

3. Click the **lock icon** 🔒 (or microphone icon 🎤) next to the URL
4. Find **"Microphone"**
5. Make sure it says **"Allow"** not "Block"
6. If it says "Block":
   - Change it to **"Allow"**
   - Refresh the page (F5)

## ✅ Step 3: Test with the New Audio Level Meter

1. In your app, click **"Develop Your Photo"**
2. Choose **"Record"** for audio
3. Click **"Start Recording"**
4. **Look for the green bar** that says "🎤 Microphone Level: X%"
5. **Speak into your microphone** or make noise
6. Watch what happens:

   - **Green bar moves (>5%)** → ✅ Perfect! Your mic is working!
   - **No bar or stays red (<5%)** → ⚠️ Your mic is too quiet or muted

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

Before recording, make sure:
- [ ] Windows sound settings show mic is connected
- [ ] Windows test bar moves when you speak
- [ ] Microphone volume is at 100%
- [ ] Browser has microphone permission (Allow)
- [ ] The green audio level bar moves when recording
- [ ] You're speaking close enough to the mic

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

Open your browser console (press **F12**) and:
1. Go to the **Console** tab
2. Try recording again
3. Look for messages like:
   - "📦 Audio chunk received: X bytes" → Should see many of these
   - "✅ Recording complete! Total size: X bytes"
   
If you see:
- **Total size < 1000 bytes** → Mic is recording nothing
- **No chunks received** → Mic permission issue
- **Large size (>10,000 bytes)** → Recording is probably working!

### Post the error messages in your browser console for more help!
